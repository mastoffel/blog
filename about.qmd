I'm Martin, an independent researcher. At the moment, I'm thinking about technical solutions to preventing the next pandemic, AI safety, and how both overlap. Previously, I built [AutoEmulate](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate), an open-source package to emulate physics simulations using machine learning at the Turing Institute; thought about parallels between cultural evolution and AI progress as a [PIBBSS fellow](https://pibbss.ai/); studied [deleterious](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23222-9) [mutations](https://academic.oup.com/evlett/article/5/3/187/6697630) in a bronze-age island sheep population; found genetic traces of the 19th century sealing industry in [pinniped populations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06695-z) around the world, consulted on whether [racehorse breeding](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=58uLFHoAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=58uLFHoAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC) actually works, and built [scientific](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12797) [open](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198311) [source](https://peerj.com/articles/11414/) [software](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12588).

Things I like: trying to write a blog, Pokemon Red, Steel Maces, Open Water Swimming, The Tao of Pooh, simplicity, playing Ukulele with my 1 year old, saying serious things in spontaneous conversations.
