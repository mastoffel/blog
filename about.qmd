I'm Martin, an independent researcher. At the moment, I'm thinking about technical solutions to preventing the next pandemic, AI safety, and how both overlap. Previously, I built an AutoML-style [package](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate) to emulate physics simulations at the Turing Institute, thought about parallels between cultural evolution and AI progress as a [PIBBSS fellow](https://pibbss.ai/), studied how [deleterious](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23222-9) [mutations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=58uLFHoAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=58uLFHoAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC) impact a bronze-age sheep population, whether the 19th century sealing industry left genetic traces in [pinniped populations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06695-z) around the world, consulted on whether [racehorse breeding](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=58uLFHoAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=58uLFHoAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC) actually works, and build [scientific](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12797) [open](https://peerj.com/articles/11414/) [source](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12588) software.

Things I like: Pokemon Red, Steel Maces, Open Water Swimming, Erich Fromm, working on design instead of function, playing Ukulele with my 1 year old, trying to write a blog, saying serious things in spontaneous conversations.
