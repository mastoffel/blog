### Experience

#### Independent Researcher / AI Engineer
*Since Mar 2025*

• Researching technical biosecurity solutions and safety of biological foundation models.  
• Building AI agents (AWS/SQL/Python/FastAPI + Claude) for a German SME.

#### Research Data Scientist / Software Engineer
*Jan 2023 - Feb 2025 | The Alan Turing Institute, Research Engineering Group*

• Created [AutoEmulate](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate), a machine learning pipeline to emulate physics simulations and cut runtime and compute by orders of magnitude; grew team 1→10 in a year; mentored PhD students; [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuPCJvH2QCA&t=1s) at AI UK; selected as part of Turing's 2025 strategic roadmap.

• Other projects: built DL models to [detect artisanal rare-earth mines](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/data-study-group-final-report-global-witness-identifying-unregulated-mining-sites) in Myanmar for Global Witness; co-created a [citizen science platform](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs); and worked on a digital twin for an [underground farm](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CROP).

#### Fellow | AI alignment
*June - September 2022 | Principles of Intelligent Behaviour in Biological and Social Systems fellowship*

Explored AI alignment and parallels to cultural & biological evolution.

#### Consultant | Data Science
*Jun – Oct 2021 • PlusVital & University College Dublin*

Delivered in under 5 months a genome-wide study of 6,000+ Thoroughbred horses; evidence for industry-wide inbreeding harms in health/performance and pinpointing genetic loci using a novel method — work published in [Proceedings of the Royal Society](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2022.0487) and now protected by [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2023232779A1/en?inventor=Emmeline+Hill).

#### Research Fellow | Evolutionary Genomics
*Apr 2019 - January 2023 | University of Edinburgh*

Led research projects in Genomics, Ecology and Evolution; produced six peer-reviewed papers (incl. [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23222-9) and [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2210756120) with >250 citations), and released open-source code pipelines on [GitHub](https://github.com/mastoffel/sheep_ID).

#### PhD | Molecular Ecology (summa cum laude)
*Jan 2015 - Dec 2018 | Bielefeld University & Liverpool John Moores University*

Joint PhD in high-throughput genomics, biostatistics and software engineering; published eight papers (> 2,500 citations); led a 10-country [collaboration](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06695-z) to study overhunting in global pinniped populations and built three open-source software packages; won the University's **best thesis award** in Biology.
